Keywords

* **site: :** The `site` keyword is used to search a specific website for a keyword. For example, if you are performing a security test for the Wiley publishing company, you could use `site: www.wiley.com password` to locate the login pages on the Wiley website. This could be useful if you wanted to test Wiley’s login pages against SQL injection attacks.
* **intitle: :** You can use the `intitle` keyword to search the title of a page for specific keywords. For example, if you want to find web pages that contain the word “intranet” in the title, you could use `intitle: intranet`.
* **inurl: :** The `inurl` operator will search the keyword given in the URLs found in the Google database. For example, if you want to locate sites that have the word “intranet” in the URL, you could use `inurl: intranet`.
* **intext: :** The `intext` operator searches a web page for specific text. For example, if you want to search my company site for pages that contain the word “video,” you could use `site: dcatt.ca intext: video`.
* **filetype: :** One of my personal favorites is the `filetype` operator, which you can use to find results containing a specific file type. For example, you could search the internet for sample penetration reports by `filetype: pdf penetration test report`.
