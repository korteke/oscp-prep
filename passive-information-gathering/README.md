# Passive Information Gathering

Passive information gathering involves using internet resources to find out publicly available information about the target that could help you exploit the target's systems and bypass security controls while performing the security assessment. 

There are different techniques to passive information gathering: you could surf public internet sites manually, query DNS, or use open-source intelligence \(OSINT\) gathering tools to automate the discovery of information.
